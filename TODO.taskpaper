Next Release 0.2:
- check cache invalidation, when method are redefined in layers
Future Release 0.3:
- deactivate layers before entering ContextR code and activate them on leave
- add activation and deactivation hooks for layers
- add some reflection methods within layers, so the hooks are easier to use
- add nice syntax to add code to a certain layer
  ContextR::layer(:foo) do
    def activated
      puts self.name + " was activated"
    end
  end
