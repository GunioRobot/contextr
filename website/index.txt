h2. What

h3. Version 1.0.0

Along with my Master's thesis, the first stable release of ContextR will be
published. To reflect its status the version number reaches 1.0. You may find
documentation and examples in the "test directory or on this 
website":test/introduction.html.

<div class="older_versions">

h3. Version 0.1.9

This is a review release. Again, lots of things changed, but I think to the 
better. There will be more coverage with the 0.2.0. Until then, have a look at
the shiny new online "documentation":test/introduction.html

h3. Version 0.1.1

In this release we have added code examples, that also act as tests. See "this 
blog article":http://www.contextr.org/2007/9/13/executable-code-in-usage-examples 
for more information. This brought vast feature coverage with test. 

An RSpec was added to allow even more test coverage. 

@Object#extend@ allows definition of class side context dependent behaviour.

There have been minor changes to the reflection API. To fetch the currently 
active layers use @ContextR::active_layers@ and you will get an array of symbols
representing them. @ContextR::layers@ gives all already defined layers, but they
are not necessarily active or have been.


h3. Version 0.1.0

This is the first release of ContextR after the 0.0.3 release. Since then a 
full redesign took place. The API changed entirely so make sure to not use 
this release with older code.

We think, that the new API is more powerful and allows better code to be written
with ContextR. Unfortunately it has some issues as well, but we consider them 
as less relevant than the other way around. If you have any problems or question
concerning these changes, feel free to use the new 
"mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/contextr - any hint is appreciated
