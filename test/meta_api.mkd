ContextR knows two basic reflection mechanisms. One is to query the currently
active layers.

    example do
      ContextR::with_layer :a do
        assert_equal([:a], ContextR::active_layers)
        ContextR::with_layer :b do
          assert_equal([:a, :b], ContextR::active_layers)
        end
        assert_equal([:a], ContextR::active_layers)
      end
    end

The second is to query all layers, that where ever defined.

    example do
      assert(ContextR::layers.include?(:a))
      assert(ContextR::layers.include?(:b))
    end
